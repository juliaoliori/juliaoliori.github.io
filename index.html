    Hello! My name is Julia Oliveri Orioles! I am a rising junior studying at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. <br>
    I am originally from Rome, Italy. <em>E' un piacere conoscervi!</em>
    <br> I grew up in a bi-racial environment since my parents are Italian and Japanese. Because of such experience, I am highly adaptable to new environments and I do enjoy being exposed to different cultures. This is now my third year living in the USA and I love it!

    On this page you will be able to see and have access to all the archives and posts I have so far about my journey and travels!
