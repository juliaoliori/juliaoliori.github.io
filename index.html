        Hello! <em> My name is Julia! </em> <br>

    <br>
    I am originally from Rome, Italy. I grew up in a bi-racial environment since my parents are Italian and Japanese. Because of such experience, I am highly adaptable to new environments and I do enjoy being exposed to different cultures. This is now my third year living in the USA!
