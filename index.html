    Hello! My name is Julia! I am a rising junior studying at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. <br>
    <em>Ciao! Mi chiamo Julia! Sono una studentessa di Boston University, e sto per iniziare il mio terzo anno. Questa pagina sara' piu' una specie di blog dove potrai vedere i miei diversi viaggi e percorsi negli Stati Uniti! </em>
    <br>
    I am originally from Rome, Italy. <br>
    <br> I grew up in a bi-racial environment since my parents are Italian and Japanese. Because of such experience, I am highly adaptable to new environments and I do enjoy being exposed to different cultures. This is now my third year living in the USA and I love it!
    <br>
    On this page you will be able to see and have access to all the archives and posts I have so far about my journey and travels!
